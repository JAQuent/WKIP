# What Key Is Pressed (WKIP) for Unity3D?
A small utility program/tool that allows you to quickly find out what the Unity KeyCode or the Unity button name of the key/button that you're currently pressing is. So that you don't have to spend ages to find this information for each input device. You can also use this to test this in settings where you can't install Unity3D.

In order to listen to key & button presses just click on `Start Recording`. This will change the background colour to red. When you click on `Stop Recording` the listening is stopped and file is saved in the same folder so you can copied the bits to use in your code. The file name is time stamped e.g. `WKIP_2022_07_06_101842.txt`. `Quit & Save` will do what it says.  

Here is an example of me using this tool:
